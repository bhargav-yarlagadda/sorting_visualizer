# SortingVisualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a React application that visualizes the Merge Sort algorithm. The application generates an array of bars with random heights and allows users to visualize the sorting process in real-time.

## Features

- **Merge Sort Visualization**: Watch the Merge Sort algorithm in action, with animated changes to the bars and dynamic height adjustments.
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Create new random arrays with adjustable size to see how the algorithm performs on different data sets.
- **Customizable Array Size**: Adjust the number of array elements using the range slider (from 5 to 50 elements).
- **Real-Time Height Updates**: As the sorting occurs, the text below each bar updates dynamically to reflect the barâ€™s new height.
